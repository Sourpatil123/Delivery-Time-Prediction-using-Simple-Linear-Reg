# Delivery-Time-Prediction-using-Simple-Linear-Reg

🚀 A Machine Learning Project using Delivery_Time & Sorting_Time Dataset
📘 Project Overview

This project implements Simple Linear Regression (SLR) to predict Delivery Time based on Sorting Time.
It demonstrates how a single independent variable can effectively model and predict outcomes in real-world logistics scenarios.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes two columns:
| Feature           | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sorting_Time**  | Time taken to sort parcels (Independent Variable – X)     |
| **Delivery_Time** | Time required to deliver parcels (Dependent Variable – Y) |

🧠 What I Did

✔ Loaded and cleaned the dataset
✔ Visualized the relationship using Scatter Plot
✔ Built a Simple Linear Regression model
✔ Trained & tested the model
✔ Evaluated performance using R² score

📊 Visualizations

A scatter plot was created to show the positive correlation between Sorting Time and Delivery Time, helping to understand the linearity before training the model.

🔢 Model Performance
| Dataset           | R² Score |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| **Training Data** | **0.73** |
| **Testing Data**  | **0.64** |
